To compare the changes in expenses, incomes, and savings across different months, the best approach is to calculate percentage changes or differences for each metric between months. Then, display the results in a table or use a graph to visualize trends more effectively.

Approach
Calculate Monthly Changes:

For each month, compute the percentage or absolute change compared to the previous month:
Absolute Change:
Change
=
Current Month
−
Previous Month
Change=Current Month−Previous Month
Percentage Change:
Percentage Change
=
(Current Month - Previous Month)
Previous Month
×
100
Percentage Change= 
Previous Month
(Current Month - Previous Month)
​
 ×100
Format Data for Display:

Create a table showing:
Month-Year
Current values for expenses, incomes, and savings
Percentage changes compared to the previous month.
Visualize Trends:

Use a line chart to plot trends for expenses, incomes, and savings over time.
Add arrows or color indicators (e.g., green for positive, red for negative changes) in the table for better interpretation.
